# Instead of calling instance variables within instance methods, can call 
# instance methods inside other instance methods by using the self keyword, 
# where self refers to the instance on which we're operating:
    # self.total, self.items, self.last_transaction, self.discount
# But, calling the instance variable, defined withing attr_accessor, within 
# an instance method does same thing.
